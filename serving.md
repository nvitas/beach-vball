# Serving

while aces are welcome they are few and far between. more important is the toughness of the serve: 1) the spot being served to and 2) the resulting pass from the opponent. the worse the pass the better the result

### Serving Wrist Positions

weak (float), neutral, strong (spin, follow through)
