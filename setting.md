# Setting

- set w/predictable and consistent trajectory with a similar height /arc is easier to hit.
- obligation of the setter to help partner w/attack by calling open area of the court
- bump setting in the wind: add a little spin to the ball for more predictable trajectory - easier to hit
- right handed athletes hit better when set to right side of their body and left handed, left side of body
- how close you set to the net depends on the defense
- taller blockers, away from net, shorter blockers - tighter sets

### Beginner

- move feet to face the target
- set up and down: set that goes up and down much easier to hit than set that goes across

### Intermediate

- work harder to get in position to set the ball
- put spin on bump set in windy conditions

### Advanced

- set a spinning ball after tough jump spin serve/pass
