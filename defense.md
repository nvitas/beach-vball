# Defense

### Quadrants

The beach court is divided into 4 sections 1 through 4. From left to right 1, 2 at the net and 3, 4 at the back.

### Procedure

The defending player decides the type of defence he/she is playing and the section he will defend. The blocker, should he choose to peel, will then know the direction to peel to.

##Types of Defences
### Possum

Possum is played from the center of the court. The defender waits just until the contact of the attack and then moves to the area decided upon. Key here is to sit in the middle until point of contact as to ot give away the position of the court being defended.

### Show and Hide

The defender decides what section to cover before hand but will set up and "show" that they are defending another area. Just before contact the defender moves quickly to the area decided.

### Show and Tell

The defender shows the section they are defending and stays in the same section after the attack.

### Read and Move

The defender chooses an section of the court to start at and then moves to cover the shot after reading the hand and shoulder position of the attacker.

## Stacking Defences and Creating Defensive Patterns

The most effective way of playing defence on the beach is by having a clear line of communication with the blocker and combining multiple defences together throughout the match. By 'stacking' different defences together the defending team has an opportunity to set up or trap the attacking side into a situation that favours the defenders. Utilizing the Show and Hide defence multiple times in a row will trains the opposing side into believing that the defender always moves away from his initial starting spot. Expecting the defender to move yet again, the attacker will likely attack the starting position of the defender. Realizing that the attacker is following along on a pattern created by the defending team, the defender can then chose to play a Show and Tell defense and decide to stay in the same spot.


The most effective teams then are those who disguise their offensive and defensive patterns well, as well as execute a given skill at the last moment therefore giving their opponents minimal amount of time to react.
