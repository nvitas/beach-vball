# The Beach 02

Three series:

- 1 vs 1: P1 | P2
- 2 vs 1: P1 + P3 | P2
- 2 vs 2: P1 + P3 | P4 + P2

### P1 | P2 series (1 vs 1)

1. P1 down ball, P2 pass to self (ball always played forward/in front)
2. P1 down ball, P2 pass to self + standing attack
3. P1 down ball, P2 tomahawk/pokey to self + standing attack
4. P1 moves short/deep after down ball, P2 shoots opposite (look across the net before attacking)
5. P2 pokey, shoot opposite
6. P2 disguise shot: show pokey, hit roll / show roll shot, hit pokey
7. P2 one arm, 3 contacts
8. P1 read the shot, play it out

### P1 + P3 | P2 series (2 vs 1)

1. add blocker P3
2. P3 peel + dig, P1 sets (P2 hits short/baby line only)
3. P3 block, play it out

### P1 + P3 | P4 + P2 series (2 vs 2)

1. no blocking, no jumping
2. short serves / jumbo shrimps
3. double set
4. attack on 2
5. blocking + jumping
6. line shots only, cross defence - defender chases shot
7. cross shots only, line defence - defender chases shot
7. baby line shots only, blocker peels plays 1st ball

### down balls

- elbow lead, high snap, follow through not necessary
- at the net (so they have to reach high)
- half-way back
- jump (step close),
- shape the ball (thumb up, thumb down)
- full serve past the baseline

### Constants throughout each drill

- ball always played forward / in front
- look across the net before attacking (to see where defender is)
- elbow lead, snap high, follow through not necessary
- disguise shots and angles when attacking
- setter moves before passer makes contact

# Defense

### Quadrants

The beach court is divided into 4 sections 1 through 4. From left to right 1, 2 at the net and 3, 4 at the back.

### Procedure

The defending player decides the type of defence he/she is playing and the section he will defend. The blocker, should he choose to peel, will then know the direction to peel to.

##Types of Defences
### Possum

Possum is played from the center of the court. The defender waits just until the contact of the attack and then moves to the area decided upon. Key here is to sit in the middle until point of contact as to ot give away the position of the court being defended.

### Show and Hide

The defender decides what section to cover before hand but will set up and "show" that they are defending another area. Just before contact the defender moves quickly to the area decided.

### Show and Tell

The defender shows the section they are defending and stays in the same section after the attack.

### Read and Move

The defender chooses an section of the court to start at and then moves to cover the shot after reading the hand and shoulder position of the attacker.

## Stacking Defences and Creating Defensive Patterns

The most effective way of playing defence on the beach is by having a clear line of communication with the blocker and combining multiple defences together throughout the match. By 'stacking' different defences together the defending team has an opportunity to set up or trap the attacking side into a situation that favours the defenders. Utilizing the Show and Hide defence multiple times in a row will trains the opposing side into believing that the defender always moves away from his initial starting spot. Expecting the defender to move yet again, the attacker will likely attack the starting position of the defender. Realizing that the attacker is following along on a pattern created by the defending team, the defender can then chose to play a Show and Tell defense and decide to stay in the same spot.


The most effective teams then are those who disguise their offensive and defensive patterns well, as well as execute a given skill at the last moment therefore giving their opponents minimal amount of time to react.


# Serving

while aces are welcome they are few and far between. more important is the toughness of the serve: 1) the spot being served to and 2) the resulting pass from the opponent. the worse the pass the better the result

### Serving Wrist Positions

weak (float), neutral, strong (spin, follow through)

# Passing
## Triangle Theory
moving triangle theory of passing : ball should be passed to a position forward and slightly towards the middle of the court. If however the ball is passed from the middle of the court the ball should be directed in a straight line towards the net

As the wind gets stronger you want to pass the ball lower
Position yourself deeper rather than closer to the net when receiving the serve as it is technically difficult to take hard driven serve with a overhand finger pass / tomahawk.

### Beginner

- always make a movement to the ball
- take 2 steps towards the ball even if not passing
- pass the ball forward and not towards partner (partner will move forward for second contact)
- focus on keeping the ball 'lower' & 'closer' than indoors

### Intermediate

- consistent passing: forward and towards the middle of the court
- Imagine two lines perpendicular to the net made from the two passers
- second ball should always be contacted between these two lines
- ball outside of these two lines is out of control or 'out of system' – balls inside these two lines: in system

### Advanced

- serves will come at you faster and will move you around the court more
- maintain a good platform when passing the ball outside of your body is vital as the serves become tougher


# Setting

- set w/predictable and consistent trajectory with a similar height /arc is easier to hit.
- obligation of the setter to help partner w/attack by calling open area of the court
- bump setting in the wind: add a little spin to the ball for more predictable trajectory - easier to hit
- right handed athletes hit better when set to right side of their body and left handed, left side of body
- how close you set to the net depends on the defense
- taller blockers, away from net, shorter blockers - tighter sets

### Beginner

- move feet to face the target
- set up and down: set that goes up and down much easier to hit than set that goes across

### Intermediate

- work harder to get in position to set the ball
- put spin on bump set in windy conditions

### Advanced

- set a spinning ball after tough jump spin serve/pass


# Blocking

- left hand represents what the blocker is going to block on the left side, right hand - right side
- vital that the blocker and defender communicate which area is going to be ‘taken out’ at the net
- think about which shots are most likely to happen given the blocking formation
- what transpired in the past that gives you information about what is likely to happen next

### Beginner

- introduce basic hand positioning and technique along with the theory of blocking and defense
- technique for retreating should be taught

### Intermediate

- shift focus from broad technique to more specialized blocking assignments

### Advanced

- tactics such as double faking on defense and transitioning after making the dig
- show a false defensive arrangement to the hitter
