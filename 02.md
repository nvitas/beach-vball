# The Beach 02

Three series:

- 1 vs 1: P1 | P2
- 2 vs 1: P1 + P3 | P2
- 2 vs 2: P1 + P3 | P4 + P2

### P1 | P2 series (1 vs 1)

1. P1 down ball, P2 pass to self (ball always played forward/in front)
2. P1 down ball, P2 pass to self + standing attack
3. P1 down ball, P2 tomahawk/pokey to self + standing attack
4. P1 moves short/deep after down ball, P2 shoots opposite (look across the net before attacking)
5. P2 pokey, shoot opposite
6. P2 disguise shot: show pokey, hit roll / show roll shot, hit pokey
7. P2 one arm, 3 contacts
8. P1 read the shot, play it out

### P1 + P3 | P2 series (2 vs 1)

1. add blocker P3
2. P3 peel + dig, P1 sets (P2 hits short/baby line only)
3. P3 block, play it out

### P1 + P3 | P4 + P2 series (2 vs 2)

1. no blocking, no jumping
2. short serves / jumbo shrimps
3. double set
4. attack on 2
5. blocking + jumping
6. line shots only, cross defence - defender chases shot
7. cross shots only, line defence - defender chases shot
7. baby line shots only, blocker peels plays 1st ball

### down balls

- elbow lead, high snap, follow through not necessary
- at the net (so they have to reach high)
- half-way back
- jump (step close),
- shape the ball (thumb up, thumb down)
- full serve past the baseline

### Constants throughout each drill

- ball always played forward / in front
- look across the net before attacking (to see where defender is)
- elbow lead, snap high, follow through not necessary
- disguise shots and angles when attacking
- setter moves before passer makes contact
