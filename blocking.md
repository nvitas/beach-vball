# Blocking

- left hand represents what the blocker is going to block on the left side, right hand - right side
- vital that the blocker and defender communicate which area is going to be ‘taken out’ at the net
- think about which shots are most likely to happen given the blocking formation
- what transpired in the past that gives you information about what is likely to happen next

### Beginner

- introduce basic hand positioning and technique along with the theory of blocking and defense
- technique for retreating should be taught

### Intermediate

- shift focus from broad technique to more specialized blocking assignments

### Advanced

- tactics such as double faking on defense and transitioning after making the dig
- show a false defensive arrangement to the hitter
