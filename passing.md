# Passing
## Triangle Theory
moving triangle theory of passing : ball should be passed to a position forward and slightly towards the middle of the court. If however the ball is passed from the middle of the court the ball should be directed in a straight line towards the net

As the wind gets stronger you want to pass the ball lower
Position yourself deeper rather than closer to the net when receiving the serve as it is technically difficult to take hard driven serve with a overhand finger pass / tomahawk.

### Beginner

- always make a movement to the ball
- take 2 steps towards the ball even if not passing
- pass the ball forward and not towards partner (partner will move forward for second contact)
- focus on keeping the ball 'lower' & 'closer' than indoors

### Intermediate

- consistent passing: forward and towards the middle of the court
- Imagine two lines perpendicular to the net made from the two passers
- second ball should always be contacted between these two lines
- ball outside of these two lines is out of control or 'out of system' â€“ balls inside these two lines: in system

### Advanced

- serves will come at you faster and will move you around the court more
- maintain a good platform when passing the ball outside of your body is vital as the serves become tougher
